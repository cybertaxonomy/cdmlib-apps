</nomenclature>
<div type="introduction"><p>An aptly named species, since it only grows along riverbanks. It has recently become very popular in cultivation, and when well-watered grows at an impressive speed. The species can be admired from the main road Ihosy-Tulear, in a large stand at Ilkaka village near the Isalo National Park.</p></div>
<div type="etymology"><p></p></div>
<div type="vernacular"><p>Gora (Sakalava), Bakaly, Vakaka (Bara), Malio (near Manera); majesty palm (in horticulture).</p></div>

STAMINATE INFLORESCENCE multiple in 5s-7s (Fl. Mad. says solitary), erect, branched to 2 orders, 86-90 cm; peduncle 32-45 cm, green, proximally 0.9-1.1 cm across and densely pubescent, distally c. 0.8 cm across and glabrescent, slightly flattened; prophyll not known; peduncular bracts (based on one collection, cut just above base) 18 cm, 85 cm, 88 cm, 71 cm (the last inserted at 13 cm from the base of the peduncle), abaxially short-pubescent; non-tubular peduncular bract at 15-30 cm from the base, membranous, 35-41 x 2 cm; rachis bracts c. 6 x 0.2 cm at the base of the rachis; rachis 52- 89 cm, slightly pubescent; branches 60-100, dense; rachillae 3-21 cm long, sinuous in the distal part; bracteole c. 0.7 x 0.4 mm; pedicel 0.5-1 mm long.

SEEDLING with 2 scale leaves and a bifid eophyll.</p></div>
<div type="distribution"><p>S central Madagascar, Mangoky and Onilahy river systems.</p></div>
<div type="biology_ecology"><p>In shallow standing water on riverbanks, swampy valley bottoms, either in deciduous forest or in gallery forest; 350-750 m; gregarious, often forming stands.</p></div>
<div type="conservation"><p>Vulnerable. Some 60 trees seen in two populations; they do not grow in any protected area.</p></div>
<div type="uses"><p>Seeds collected for export.</p></div>
<div type="discussion"><p>The protologue mentions two populations, at Imaloto at the foot of the Isalo and at the Matitina R. near the sea (E Madagascar); the first one must have been the Perrier collection chosen as lectotype (which has staminate and pistillate flowers, as well as young fruit, just as in the protologue); the second one is only cited as Perrier s.n. in the Flore de Madagascar, a specimen which we have not seen; this might be an early collection of R. musicalis, the only eastern species looking vaguely like R. rivularis. HB has searched for palms at the site indicated, but failed to find a single (wild) one; older people did not know of any native palms, nor did they recognize the local name given (Akoraka in the Tanala language). Jumelle (1927b) mentions populations seen on Makay sandstone, in the Mangoky basin; the Flore de Madagascar adds the Sakeny R. valley (Menabe) and Madiovalo, just West of Ambato-Boeni, near the mouth of the Betsiboka R.; and the Bongolava (without mentioning which one; the name just means long plateau and there are several). The first three sites are indicated on the map by question marks. We consider the Madiovalo and Bongolava ones as unlikely; possibly these refer to riverside trees of R. sambiranensis, which has been collected in such a habitat on the (Miandrivazo) Bongolava.</p></div>

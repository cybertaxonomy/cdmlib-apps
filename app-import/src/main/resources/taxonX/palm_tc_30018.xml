<div type="discussion"><p>A relatively broad concept of C. vitiensis has been employed here as a pragmatic solution to an intractable taxonomic problem. Highly variable and widely distributed, Calamus vitiensis can be recognised by its simple triangular spines, which are usually of rather uniform size and are only slightly swollen at the base, and by the regular arrangement of cirrus grapnel spines. In addition, the sheath spines in most forms are largely solitary whereas the sheath spines of other members of the C. aruensis complex are usually at least partly organised into partial whorls with solitary spines interspersed among the whorls. Rarely, partial whorls of up to six spines may be observed intermixed with solitary spines (see Fig 18 in Dowe 1989), but it is possible that this feature is accentuated in juvenile sheaths. Calamus aruensis bears sheath spines of rather uniform size and, in less heavily armed forms, whorled sheath spines may not be present, but it is immediately distinguished from C. vitiensis by its cirrus with irregularly arranged grapnel spines. Unarmed forms occur in both C. vitiensis and C. aruensis, but again the cirrus morphology can be used to distinguish them. In New Guinea, Calamus vitiensis may also be confused with C. pachypus, but it lacks the conspicuously swollen spine bases that are so characteristic of C. pachypus (Fig. 1D), as well as sheath spines consistently organised into whorls.
Regional entities can be recognised within the variation of C. vitiensis. In New Guinea, all forms appear to have leaflets grouped in divaricate pairs and sheaths, when armed, with rather short spines. Even more uniform is the Australian form with similar leaf morphology to the New Guinea form, but with larger and more numerous sheath spines. In the west Pacific, from the Solomon Islands to Vanuatu and Fiji, the species bears regularly arranged leaflets and some specimens display conspicuous brown indumentum on the leaf sheath. A narrower species concept might be advocated by some, but the characters distinguishing these regional forms are so limited and unreliable that formal taxonomic recognition cannot yet be justified. Further study, especially in the west Pacific, is required to clarify further the taxonomy of this species.
The holotype of C. vitiensis was destroyed in Berlin and the isotype at Florence consists only of a single pistillate rachilla and a fragment of a fruit. However, we are able to use the name with confidence because of the detailed protologue, which includes a photograph of the holotype, and because no other rattan species is known from Fiji, the country of origin of the type. No appreciable differences can be discerned between C. vitiensis and the type of C. vanuatuensis, despite assertions to the contrary in the protologue of the latter. Similarly, C. stipitatus fits well within the range of variation accepted for C. vitiensis here. The distinctive stipitate pistillate flower clusters that are present on the type of C. stipitatus are formed by elongation of the axis of the terminal sterile staminate flower, which is otherwise usually condensed, and adnation of the floral bracteole to that axis. This feature is also found in some other specimens of Calamus vitiensis.

<div type="discussion"><p>Undoubtedly the most common and widespread of all rattans in New Guinea, this robust species occurs throughout the lowlands of the island. In its most distinctive form, the palm is solitary, bears regularly arranged leaflets and is armed with numerous stiff, dark, triangular spines throughout the sheath. However, unarmed forms are well known and have been found growing together with the heavily armed form. Intermediates are also frequent and vary widely in the density of spines on the sheath. Inflorescence and leaf morphology is largely uniform, although subregular leaflet arrangements have been recorded. The armature of the cirrus distinguishes C. aruensis from all other members of the complex. Typically, a cirrus is armed with regularly arranged whorls of recurved, grapnel-like spines. However, the grapnel-like spines of C. aruensis are not arranged regularly, but are scattered irregularly throughout the cirrus. This feature is known in a few other rattan species, such as C. pogonacanthus Becc. ex H.Winkl. from Borneo, but is not known in other members of the C. aruensis complex or, indeed, in any other Papuasian or Pacific rattan. 
Calamus aruensis is recorded from the Aru Islands, the Solomon Islands and Australia, as well as from New Guinea. Some regional morphological variants are known. For example, Australian collections indicate that the species can be caespitose and Solomon Islands collections display unusual sheath spines which are divided at their apices into multiple, acute points. Although these observations are noteworthy, the specimens are otherwise unequivocally attributable to C. aruensis. In addition, the sympodial flower cluster of the pistillate inflorescence, which normally consists of a terminal, sterile, staminate flower and a lateral, fertile, pistillate flower, very infrequently includes an additional pistillate flower.
Although the type specimen of C. hollrungii lacks a leaf sheath, the available material leaves no doubt that it is synonymous with C. aruensis. For example, the type collection includes the basal part of a cirrus which bears irregularly arranged grapnel spines. Calamus latisectus, too, is here placed in synonymy with C. aruensis; to be fair to Burret he synonymised it with C. hollrungii (1939) only three years after he had described it.
Calamus aruensis yields a high quality, moderately large diameter cane that has already been used on a small scale for furniture production. The cane is also widely used as cordage for various general purposes, though this may be a reflection of its ready availability rather than its suitability for specific uses. Nevertheless, in view of the nature of the cane and the relative abundance of the resource, C. aruensis is the most promising target species in New Guinea for commercial exploitation.</p></div>

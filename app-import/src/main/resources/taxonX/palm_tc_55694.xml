<div type="description"><p>Robust clustering short-stemmed rattan with stems rarely more than 3 m long; stem without sheaths up to 25 mm diam., with sheaths to 40 mm diam.; internodes 8-12 mm. Leaf sheaths usually split opposite the petiole, pale yellowish green, densely armed with dull grey spines of varied length, scattered or arranged in horizontal or oblique partial whorls, reflexed or erect, generally to 40 x 3 mm except by leaf sheath mouth where to 120 x 4 mm, erect and &#177; papery; caducous chocolate-brown scales present on young sheaths. Knee hardly developed. Ocrea inconspicuous. Leaf cirrate rather massive to 2.5 m including short cirrus to 40 cm and petiole to 40 cm; petiole armed near the base with marginal groups of pale grey spines to 60 x 3 mm, and much shorter vertical spines, armature decreasing distally; leaflets c 60 on each side of the rachis, close, regularly arranged, stiff, bright green, the longest to 35 x 2.4 cm, armed with short marginal teeth; sparse bristles on 3 nerves on upper surface and a conspicuous row of bristles to 1.5 mm on lower surface of main vein; transverse veinlets crowded, somewhat sinuous, rather obscure. Male and female inflorescences superficially similar, to 70 cm, borne on short basal peduncles to 5 cm; bracts &#177; woody textured, the basal persistant and more densely armed than the rest, with abundant grey black spines to 25 mm pointing in all directions and a few papery spines to 60 mm at the tip, and abundant brown indumentum; partial inflorecences c 10, to c 10 cm; male rachilla c 4 mm, very slender; female rachilla c 25 x 2 mm. Fruit rounded c 10 mm diam.; other details not known.</p></div>

<div type="discussion"><p>D. banggiensis grows in lowland forest developed on the soft reef limestone at the southern end of Banggi Is.; here it is abundant, and one of the very few species of rattan in this forest type. It is probably closely related to D. curranii of Palawan. Its robust size, and fierce armature distinguish it from other members of the complex of species related to D. hystrix.</p></div>

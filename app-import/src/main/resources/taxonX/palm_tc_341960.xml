INFLORESCENCE interfoliar to infrafoliar, branched to 1 (-2) orders, with orange axes, arching; peduncle 13-53 cm long, distally 2-7 mm diam., pubescent; prophyll 7-40 cm long, 7-10 mm wide, borne at 1-11 cm above the base of the peduncle, open for the distal 1-7 cm, patchily pubescent; peduncular bract inserted at 5-45 cm from the base of the peduncle, circumscissile and rapidly deciduous, 9-24 cm long, with scattered scales, with a beak to 3 cm long; non-tubular peduncular bract 0.2-3.8 cm long; rachis 1.5-17 cm long, densely pubescent, orange, with 0 (-3) branched and 4-12 unbranched first order branches; rachillae 5-24 cm long, 1.5-5 mm diam., with dense to scattered scales (rarely glabrous) and distant triads. STAMINATE FLOWERS with sepals 1.2-2 x 0.7-2.3 mm; petals orange, connate for 0.5-0.8 mm, free lobes 1.5-2.8 x 1- 2.2 mm; stamens 6, uniseriate or rarely slightly biseriate (offset 0.1-0.3 mm), filaments 0.4- 1.2 mm, anthers 0.8-1.8 x 0.4-1 mm, versatile; pistillode 0.6-1.3 x 0.2-0.7 mm, conical with obtuse apex. PISTILLATE FLOWERS with sepals 1- 2 x 1.3-3.3 mm; petals 2.5-3.6 x 2.3-3.5 mm; staminodes 0.2-0.6 mm; gynoecium 2.8-4 x 2-3.2 mm. FRUIT yellow to red, 6-9 x 4-6 mm. SEED 5-6.5 x 3-3.3 mm, with homogeneous endosperm.</p></div>
<div type="distribution"><p>Quite widespread on the middle altitudes of the eastern escarpment between Zahamena and Andohahela.</p></div>
<div type="biology_ecology"><p>Bamboo-rich montane forest on steep slopes, secondary bush on white gritty sand; hillcrest or mid-slope; 250-1450 m.</p></div>

<div type="discussion"><p>The protologue of D. linearis incorporates characters of both syntypes (Forsyth Major 604 and 606) but as the floral characters derive clearly from Forsyth Major 606, we choose that as the holotype. Forsyth Major 604 is D. heterophylla. We have decided that the differences between C. ambolo, N. procumbens and D. linearis are spurious, and we hereby put C. ambolo and N. procumbens in the synonymy of D. linearis, which is the oldest name.  
The type of C. ambolo has up to six petals, the innermost much smaller than the outer; there may be up to eight stamens. The peduncular bract of C. ambolo was considered to be that of a Chrysalidocarpus, and therefore Jumelle felt in 1928 this was a Chrysalidocarpus, but the specific epithet was already in use in that genus. C. ambolocaused Jumelle problems. He had drawn up a list of differences between the genera Neophloga and Chrysalidocarpus based on the peduncular bract (deciduous, beaked and splitting all over from the apex downwards in Chrysalidocarpus, remaining and splitting only at or near the apex in Neophloga), the leaf sheath (membranous in Neophloga, coriaceous in Chrysalidocarpus) and the habit, plus a few more characters of the "sometimes, but not always" kind. This taxon, first described by him in Neophloga, then had to be put in Chrysalidocarpus because of the peduncular bract, which was beaked; a problem was that the leaf sheath was of the Neophloga kind (membranous). In 1945 it had, without explanation, been returned to Neophloga with the note that it had all the characters of that genus, but the peduncular bract of a Chrysalidocarpus. N. procumbens was mentioned by Jumelle (1929), but not treated; Jumelle wondered whether this was a Neophloga or a Chrysalidocarpus, because of the lack of a peduncular bract on the older inflorescence he saw. N. linearis var. distachya is D. heterophylla. Moramanga: Ambatovola, 1912 (fl.), Perrier 11994 (P) is probably this species, but has regular leaflets. It is described by Perrier as clustering and 1-2.5 m high, but has the typical yellow-orange inflorescence axes. One inflorescence has a bifurcate proximal rachilla.</p></div>
